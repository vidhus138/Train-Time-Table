# Train-Time-Table
A php code to create time table for trains.
The code is similar to one uploaded by me earlier in the repository bread-butter.
It is used to display a time table of trains.
I have assumed that there will be 5 maximum trains on a day. It can vary from user to user.
They html form takes input in the form of table which would include - train name, origin place, destination, arrival time, departure time and platform number for each train.
Once you click generate timetable/submit button, the output would be shown in form of a table.
